#functions
# we use def to define a function
#indentation is important
# When naming a function we need to make sure we are not using a reseved python key word


def helloworld():
    print ("\n Hello this is my first function...")

# If i will not call the function nothing will happen and no value will be returned.
# calling the function
helloworld()
